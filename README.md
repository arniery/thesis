@ Trinity College Dublin CLCS/SLP Programme: Modifying the TTS pipeline and voice conversion models for the accent conversion task

inference3.ipynb : includes custom hifi-gan training, config modification, and debugging scripts as well as the full "experiment 1" pipeline. To skip the .npy file load, scroll 2/3rds-3/4ths of the way down the file to view the rest.

miniexperiment.ipynb :

a_b.wav is an example result from the miniexperiment notebook. if you'd like to try running/producing other examples, you can generate neutral phrases in the "gTTS" section and replace the speech1.npy in path1 with the source file of your choosing.

Notebooks are completely open for download and further research if you think you can produce a result from experiment 1 (inference3). Don't hesitate to contact me if you do create a listenable audio from this pipeline. Sources for code and research are linked below.
